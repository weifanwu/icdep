How can we add additional features to the protocol without breaking previous functionality?

in this problem, we assume that the content in this card stores ASCII text
in order to add some extensions to the card itself, we need to add some marks on the
cards, the marks indicated some extra functionalities. this is functionlity called alter
whenever the other node tries to change the ASCII text inside of the card, the node can call
this function and put some new values into the card.
